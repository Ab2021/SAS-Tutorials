Although the words "errors" and "residuals" are used interchangeably in discussing issues related to regression, they are actually different terms.
In statistics, errors and residuals are two closely related and easily confused measures of the deviation of an observed value of a sample from its "theoretical value" (based on the whole population).
• The error of an observed value is the deviation of the observed value from the true value of a quantity of interest (for example, a population mean).
• The residual of an observed value is the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean). The distinction is most important in regression analysis, where the concepts are sometimes called the regression errors and regression residuals.
In the basic linear regression model, the term E (error) reflects the fact that the regression isn’t perfect and won’t fit our data 100%. There are random factors other than the independent variable(s) affecting this relationship. They are unknown and we can only make basic assumptions about them in order for the model to work, such as independence , equal variance and normality.
The sum of the residuals within a random sample is always zero, and thus the residuals are not independent. The statistical errors on the other hand are independent, and their sum within the random sample is almost surely not zero.
While errors are unobservable, residuals are observable: we can calculate residuals; that is, we can find out the difference between each of our y values and their corresponding fitted values that lie on the regression line.
